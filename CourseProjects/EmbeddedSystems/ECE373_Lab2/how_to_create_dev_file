step 1: compile the file homework2.c by running the "make" command 


step 2: insert module by running "sudo insmod homework2.ko" command


step 3: Use the "dmesg | tail -10" command to see messages that were printed into the kernel. The last message should tell you the dynamically-allocated major number.


step 4: Use "cat proc/devices | less" command to confirm major number


step 5: Make special file by using the "sudo mknod /dev/homework2 c 'dynamically-allocated major number(found in step 3)' 'desired first minor number(usually zero)'" command. The c is for character device (b for block device). Also, the file name can be anything (in this case it is homework2).


step 6: Use "ls -l /dev/homework2" to confirm special file was created.


step 7(optional): You can read the special file by using "cat /dev/homework2".


step 8: You can again see printed messages within the kernel using "dmesg".


step 9: Use "gcc -g -o cprogram cprogram.c" to compile userspace program.


step 10: Use "sudo ./cprogram" to run userspace program


step 11(optional): To remove inserted module use the "sudo rmmod homework2" command.
