This folder contains code examples that contributed to my studies into UVM. 
This was done using example codes from Doulos where I examined and studied the purpose of each line of code.
My study into the concepts of UVM should be contained in a separate folder one directory back.
This is a work in progress; I moved onto Python verification instead. May come back to this content in the future; however, the majority of the concepts I have grasped.
